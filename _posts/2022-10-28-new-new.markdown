It's an exciting day! Today marks the launch of wuhsapineen's GitHub Pages site and this is the very first post.

Here, I'll be testing a few things to demonstrate how it's displayed on the site. We're currently running Jekyll using GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) processor as opposed to the default kramdown.

CSS Absolute URL: {{ "/assets/style.css" | absolute_url }}
Slugify "The _config.yml file": {{ "The _config.yml file" | slugify: "pretty" }}

If statement:
{%- if site.copyright -%}
Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under the <a href="{{ site.copyright | first }}" target="_blank">{{ site.copyright | last }}</a>
{%- endif -%}


{% highlight markdown%}
Some code block
actual words

not real code
    but still pretty
    looking

end
{% endhighlight %}
