It's an exciting day! Today marks the launch of wuhsapineen's GitHub Pages site and this is the very first post.

Here, I'll be testing a few things to demonstrate how it's displayed on the site. We're currently running Jekyll using GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) processor as opposed to the default kramdown.

CSS Absolute URL: {{ "/assets/css/style.scss" | absolute_url }}

Slugify "The _config.yml file": {{ "The _config.yml file" | slugify: "pretty" }}

{% highlight markdown%}
.Some: "code";
ActualWords() {

    notRealCodeBlock() {
        but = still pretty
        looking;
    };
};
end;
{% endhighlight %}
