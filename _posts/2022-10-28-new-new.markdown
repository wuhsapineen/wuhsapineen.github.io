It's an exciting day! Today marks the launch of wuhsapineen's GitHub Pages site and this is the very first post.

Here, I'll be testing a few things to demonstrate how it's displayed on the site. We're currently running Jekyll using GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) processor as opposed to the default kramdown.

CSS URL: {{ "/assets/style.css" | absolute_url }}


{% highlight %}
Some code block
actual words

end
{% endhighlight %}
