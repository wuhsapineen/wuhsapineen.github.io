# How to Create a C Corporation

*Creating a C corporation is similar to the process of formalizing other types of business entities. These are the procedures for establishing one:*

1.   Choose and register an unregistered business name.

1.   File the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State according to the laws of that state.
    
1.  Next, C corporations offer stock to shareholders, who become owners of the corporation.
1.  Next, all C corporations must file Form SS-4 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN).[1][c1] Although requirements vary across jurisdictions, C corporations are required to submit state, income, payroll, unemployment, and disability taxes. There may be other regulatory requirements, depending on what business the new company works in.
1.  In addition to registration and tax requirements, corporations must establish a board of directors to oversee management and the operation of the entire corporation. Appointing a board of directors seeks to resolve the principal-agent dilemma, in which moral hazard and conflicts of interest arise when an agent works on behalf of a principal.

# Forming an LLC

Although the requirements for LLCs vary by state, there are generally some commonalities. The very first thing owners or members must do is to choose a name.

Articles of organization can then be documented and filed with the state. These articles establish the rights, powers, duties, liabilities, and other obligations of each member of the LLC. Other information included in the documents includes the names and addresses of the LLC's members, the name of the LLC's registered agent, and the business' statement of purpose.

The articles of organization are filed, along with a fee paid directly to the state. Paperwork and additional fees must also be submitted at the federal level to obtain an employer identification number (EIN).[2][c2]
